# Personal Research Agent

This project automates the process of gathering, organizing, and managing research insights using **n8n**, **SerpAPI**, and **Google Sheets**.

## Overview
The Personal Research Agent is designed to reduce information overload and streamline research. It automates data collection from search results, structures it, and stores it in a centralized spreadsheet for easy review and future analysis.

## Features
- **Automated Data Gathering**: Fetches top search results, snippets, and related insights via SerpAPI.
- **Data Normalization**: Cleans and structures raw API responses for consistency.
- **Centralized Storage**: Appends collected data into Google Sheets with organized columns.
- **(Upcoming)** AI Summarization using Hugging Face for concise summaries of collected insights.

## Workflow Summary
1. **üß† Fetch AI Trends (SerpAPI)** ‚Äì Retrieves top articles and insights for a given topic.  
2. **‚öôÔ∏è Normalize API Response** ‚Äì Formats the raw JSON data into a structured layout.  
3. **üìä Save Data to Google Sheet** ‚Äì Stores all results in Google Sheets for reference.
